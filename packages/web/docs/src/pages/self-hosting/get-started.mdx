# Self-Hosting GraphQL Hive

If you can not use the GraphQL Hive SaaS service, you can self-host it. The self-hosted version is
free and open-source. You can find the full source code on GitHub.

<Callout>
  **Self-hosting GraphQL Hive** does currently not support all of the features as the SaaS version.

The following features are currently unavailable when self-hosting:

- CDN (high availability integration)
- Billing (payment integration)
- Usage rate-limiting

</Callout>

## Pre-Requisites

The easiest way of running GraphQL Hive is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

All the services required for running GraphQL Hive are published to the GitHub container registry
([GraphQL Hive Docker Images](https://github.com/kamilkisiela?tab=packages&repo_name=graphql-hive)).

Please make sure to install the Docker daemon as well as `docker-compose` on your machine before
proceeding.

## Running GraphQL Hive

First download the `docker-compose.community.yml` file from the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/blob/main/docker-compose.community.yml)
using `wget`.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/main/docker-compose.community.yml
```

After downloading the file, you need to set some environment variables.

<Callout>
  **Docker Tag.** Docker images are built and published for each single commit within the GraphQL
  Hive repository and tagged with the corresponding commit sha. You can also find all available
  images on the [Hive Docker Registry
  Overview](https://github.com/kamilkisiela?tab=packages&repo_name=graphql-hive). We recommend using
  one of the latest versions. Right now we do not have a stable release strategy yet. However, every
  commit on the `main` branch can be considered as stable as it is the version we are running in
  production. After picking a version set the `DOCKER_TAG` environment variable to that value (e.g.
  `export DOCKER_TAG=":3b635063294a4636ee89579f57e531de04ef087f"`). We do not recommend using the
  tag `latest`. Instead use an exact commit from the `main` branch.
</Callout>

```bash
export DOCKER_REGISTRY="ghcr.io/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/"
export DOCKER_TAG=":latest"
export HIVE_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
export HIVE_APP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
export HIVE_EMAIL_FROM="no-reply@graphql-hive.com"
export SUPERTOKENS_API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
export CLICKHOUSE_USER="clickhouse"
export CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
export REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
export POSTGRES_USER="postgres"
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
export POSTGRES_DB="registry"
```

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend saving the environment variables in a file that you can reuse later. E.g. a `.env` file that you
  can later on expand using `source .env`. We are using `openssl` here for generating passwords on the fly.

You can also embed the values within a new docker-compose file by running
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.community.yml config > docker-compose.with-env.yml` after setting
the environment variables.

</Callout>

After setting the environment variables, you can start the GraphQL Hive services using
`docker-compose`.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.community.yml up
# or of you embedded the environment variables
docker-compose -f docker-compose.with-env.yml up
```

Wait until all the services are up and running.

Congratulations 🥳, you just started your own GraphQL Hive instance.

Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and start using GraphQL Hive! The usage reporting
endpoint is bound to `http://localhost:8081`.

## Next Steps

After doing your first testing with GraphQL Hive you should consider the following steps:

- Evaluate whether you want to run Databases yourself within Docker or instead use a managed
  database service.
- Set up backups for your data.
- Set up a CD pipeline for deploying GraphQL Hive to your Cloud Provider or bare-metal server of
  choice (e.g. a Kubernetes cluster or Docker Swarm)
- Set up a monitoring solution for your GraphQL Hive instance (leverage healthchecks, sentry error
  reporting, prometheus metrics, etc.).
- Configure the `emails` service to use a real email provider (by default it uses `sendmail`).
- Watch and follow the
  [GraphQL Hive GitHub repository](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive) for new releases
  and updates.
- Set up a weekly reminder for updating your GraphQL Hive instance to the latest version and
  applying maintenance.
- Get yourself familiar with SuperTokens and follow their changelogs in order to keep your
  SuperTokens instance up-to-date.

You can review the configuration options of all the services in the corresponding Readme files.
