# Envelop

## Installation

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-hive/client']} />

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend installing Hive Client package as a direct dependency of your project, because it
  includes a runtime to send usage reports and schemas to Hive registry.
</Callout>

The `@graphql-hive/client` package exports an
[Envelop plugin](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/envelop), that can be used directly with any server
that supports Envelop.

### Publishing Schemas

You can report schemas to Hive registry by using the `reporting` section of the configuration:

```ts
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { useHive } from '@graphql-hive/client'
import { schema } from './schema'

const plugin = useHive({
  enabled: true, // Enable/Disable Hive Client
  debug: true, // Debugging mode
  token: 'YOUR-TOKEN',
  // Schema reporting
  reporting: {
    // feel free to set dummy values here
    author: 'Author of the schema version',
    commit: 'git sha or any identifier'
  }
})

// Now use `plugin` with your server, pass it as Envelop plugin.
```

### Usage Reporting

You can send usage reporting to Hive registry by using the `usage` section of the configuration:

```ts
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { schema } from './schema'

const plugin = useHive({
  enabled: true, // Enable/Disable Hive Client
  token: 'YOUR-TOKEN',
  reporting: { ... },
  usage: true
})
```
