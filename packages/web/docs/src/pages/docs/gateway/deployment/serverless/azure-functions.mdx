# Deploying Hive Gateway to Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless environment that supports JavaScript. Hive Gateway is platform
agnostic and can be deployed to Azure Functions as well.

<Callout>
  Before you start, make sure you read the [Serverless / On the
  Edge](/docs/gateway/deployment/serverless) page.
</Callout>

See [Bundling Problems](/docs/gateway/deployment/serverless#bundling-problem) for more details about
how to load the supergraph and `transports` option.

```ts
import { app } from '@azure/functions'
import { createGatewayRuntime } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'
import http from '@graphql-mesh/transport-http'
import supergraph from './supergraph'

export const gateway = createGatewayRuntime({
  // All options available in `gateway.config.ts` configuration can also be passed here.
  supergraph,
  transports: {
    http // For example, http transport is required for subgraphs using standard GraphQL over HTTP.
  }
})

app.http('graphql', {
  method: ['GET', 'POST'],
  gateway
})
```
