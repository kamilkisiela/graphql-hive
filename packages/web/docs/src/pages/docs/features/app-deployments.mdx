# App Deployments

App deployments are a way to group and publish your GraphQL operations as a single app version to
the Hive Registry. This allows you to keep track of your different app versions, their operations
usage, and performance.

Making better decisions about:

- Which operations are being used by what app client version (mobile app, web app, etc.)
- Which team or developer is responsible for a specific operation and needs to be contacted for
  Schema change decissions

```mermaid

Deployment" -->B
```

Furthermore, it allows you to leverage persisted documents (also knows as trusted documents or
persisted queries) on your GraphQL Gateway or server, which provides the following benefits:

- Reduce payload size of your GraphQL requests (reduce client bandwidth usage)
- Secure your GraphQL API by only allowing operations that are known and trusted by your Gateway

## Create an App Deployment

To create an app deployment, you need to have
[the Hive CLI installed](/docs/api-reference/cli#installation) and authenticated with your Hive
target, on which you want to deploy your app.

In addition you must have a JSON file containing a set of persisted documents generated by a tool
such as
[GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/presets/preset-client#persisted-documents).

```json filename="Example: persisted-operations.json"
{
  "d9a00ec0c1ce": "query UsageEstimationQuery($input: UsageEstimationInput!) { __typename usageEstimation(input: $input) { __typename operations } }",
  "b8d98e796421": "mutation GenerateStripeLinkMutation($selector: OrganizationSelectorInput!) { __typename generateStripePortalLink(selector: $selector) }"
}
```

These persisted documents define all the possible operations that your app can execute against your
GraphQL API.

As long as the app is using these persisted documents is active, any change of the GraphQL API that
alters the GraphQL schema as used by any of the persisted documents would break that specific app
version and therefore be an unsafe/breaking change.

> **Note:** The GraphQL operations being uploaded must pass validation against the target schema.
> Otherwise, the app deployment creation will fail.

Once these pre-requisites are met, you can create an app deployment by running the following
command:

```bash filename="Create an App Deployment via CLI"
hive app:create --name "my-app" --version "1.0.0" persisted-operations.json
```

The parameters `--name` and `--version` are mandatory and uniquily identify your app deployment.

| Parameter                | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--name`                 | The name of the app deployment.                               |
| `--version`              | The version of the app deployment.                            |
| `persistedDocumentsFile` | The path to the JSON file containing the persisted documents. |

An app deployment is uniquely identified by the combination of the `name` and `version` parameters
for each target.

After creating an app deployment, it is in the pending state. That means you can view it on the Hive
App UI.

Navigate to the Target page on the Hive Dashboard and click on the **Apps** tab to see it.

import pendingAppImage from '../../../../public/docs/pages/features/app-deployments/pending-app.png'

<NextImage
  alt="Pending App Deployment"
  src={pendingAppImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

By clicking on the app deployments name, you can navigate to the app deployment details page, where
you can see all the GraphQL operations that are uploaded as part of this app deployment.

import detailAppImage from '../../../../public/docs/pages/features/app-deployments/detail-app.png'

<NextImage
  alt="App Deployment Detail View"
  src={detailAppImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

## Publish an App Deployment

A app deployment will be in the pending state until you publish it. By publishing the app
deployment, the persisted documents will be available via the Hive CDN and can be used by your
Gateway or GraphQL API for serving persisted documents to your app.

To publish an app deployment, you can run the following command. Make sure you utilize the same
`--name` and `--version` parameters as you used when creating the app deployment.

```bash filename="Publish an App Deployment via CLI"
hive app:publish --name "my-app" --version "1.0.0"
```

| Parameter   | Description                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `--name`    | The name of the app deployment.    |
| `--version` | The version of the app deployment. |

After publishing the app deployment, the persisted documents, the status of the app deployment on
the Hive dashboard will change to **active**.

import activeAppImage from '../../../../public/docs/pages/features/app-deployments/active-app.png'

<NextImage
  alt="Active App Deployment"
  src={activeAppImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

## Persisted Documents on GraphQL Server and Gateway

Persisted documents can be used on your GraphQL server or Gateway to reduce the payload size of your
GraphQL requests and secure your GraphQL API by only allowing operations that are known and trusted
by your Gateway.

Hive serves as the source of truth for the allowed persisted documents and provides a CDN for
fetching these documents as they are requested.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL Yoga', 'Apollo Server', 'GraphQL Mesh', 'Custom Third-Party Integration']}>

{/* GraphQL Yoga */}

<Tabs.Tab>

For GraphQL Yoga you can use the Hive CDN for resolving persisted documents via the Hive SDK.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @graphql-hive/yoga
```

```typescript filename="Persisted Documents with GraphQL Yoga" {10-16}
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-hive'
import { useHive } from '@graphql-hive/yoga'
import schema from './schema.js'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema,
  plugins: [
    useHive({
      enabled: false
      experimental__persistedDocuments: {
        cdn: {
          // replace <target_id> and <cdn_access_token> with your values
          endpoint: 'https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/<target_id>',
          accessToken: '<cdn_access_token>'
        }
      }
    })

{/* GraphQL Mesh */}

<Tabs.Tab>

For GraphQL Mesh you can use the Hive configuration for resolving persisted documents. Adjust your
`mesh.config.ts` file as follows.

```typescript filename="mesh.config.ts" {7-13}
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/serve-cli'

export default defineConfig({
  hive: {
    // The endpoint of CDN
    endpoint: 'https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/<target_id>/supergraph',
    experimental__persistedDocuments: {
      cdn: {
        // replace <target_id> and <cdn_access_token> with your values
        endpoint: 'https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/<target_id>',
        accessToken: '<cdn_access_token>'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

For further configuration options, please refer to the
[Hive Client API reference](/docs/api-reference/client).

</Tabs.Tab>

{/* Custom Third Party */}

<Tabs.Tab>

Any published app deployment is available via the Hive CDN. You can fetch a the persisted documents
by doing a HTTP GET request.

```text filename="Fetch Persisted Document via HTTP"
GET https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/<target_id>/apps/<app_name>/<app_version>/<document_hash>
```

| Parameter       | Description                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `target_id`     | The target ID of the Hive target where the app deployment is published. |
| `app_name`      | The name of the app deployment.                                         |
| `app_version`   | The version of the app deployment.                                      |
| `document_hash` | The hash of the persisted document.                                     |

**Example curl request:**

```bash filename="Example curl request"
curl \
  -L \
  -H 'X-Hive-CDN-Key: CDN_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/<target_id>/apps/<app_name>/<app_version>/<document_hash>
```

**Expected responses:**

| Response Status | Description                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200             | The persisted document was found and is returned in the response body.  |
| 404             | The persisted document does not exist.                                  |
| 401             | The request is unauthorized. A valid CDN access token must be provided. |

## Sending Persisted Document Requests from your App

Once you have the persisted documents available on your GraphQL server or Gateway, you can send a
GraphQL request with the persisted document ID following the GraphQL over HTTP specification.

```text filename="GraphQL Request with Persisted Document"
POST /graphql
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "documentId": "<app_name>/<app_version>/<document_hash>",
}
```

| Parameter       | Description                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `app_name`      | The name of the app deployment.     |
| `app_version`   | The version of the app deployment.  |
| `document_hash` | The hash of the persisted document. |

**Example curl request:**

```bash filename="Example curl request"
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"documentId": "<app_name>/<app_version>/<document_hash>"}' \
  http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

## CD Integration

We recommend integrating the app deployment creation and publishing into your CD pipeline for
automating the creationg and publishing of app deployments.

Usually the following steps are performed.

```mermaid

graph TD
    A[Extract Persisted Documents from App] --> B[Create App Deployment via Hive CLI]
    B --> C[Publish App Deployment via Hive CLI]
    C --> D[Deploy Application]
```

Since the application will be configured to send requests with the persisted document ID, we need to
ensure that these documents are available on the Hive CDN before deploying the application.

Extracting the persisted documents usually happens during the build step of your application. E.g.
if you are using GraphQL Code Generator with the client preset or Relay, the persisted document JSON
mapping is generated as an artifact.

In your CLI pipeline, you can then use the Hive CLI (or Hive CLI docker container) to create and
publish the app deployment.

After that, you can deploy your application with confidence.

Tools like GitHub Actions, Pulumni, or Terraform can be used to model this flow. We use it ourselves
for
[deploying the GraphQL Hive Dashboard using Pulumni](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/blob/main/deployment/utils/publish-app-deployment.ts).
