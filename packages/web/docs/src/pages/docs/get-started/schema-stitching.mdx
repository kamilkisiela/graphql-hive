# Guide: Schema-Stitching Project

Once you've created a Hive project of type **Schema-Stitching**, you can simply push your GraphQL
schema to the registry. This guide will guide you through the basics of schema pushing, checking and
fetching, and also the implementation of a simple schema-stitching gateway.

This guide is going to use the
[Stitching Directives approach](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/stitching/docs/approaches/stitching-directives)
of Schema-Stitching; the advantage of this approach is that all schema and type merging
configuration is represented in a single document managed by each subservice, and can be reloaded by
the gateway without the need to specify any stitching configurations on the gateway.

<Steps>

### Schemas and Services

For this guide, we are going to use the following schemas and services:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="subschemas" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="users.graphql" />
    <FileTree.File name="posts.graphql" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Here's the GraphQL schema (SDL) for every service we are going to publish to Hive:

<Tabs items={['Users', 'Posts']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

<Callout type="info">
  The `@merge` directive denotes a root field used to query a merged type across services. The
  `keyField` argument specifies the name of a field to pick off origin objects as the key value.

The `@canonical` directive specifies types and fields that provide a
[canonical definition](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/stitching/docs/approaches/type-merging#canonical-definitions)
to be built into the gateway schema.

[You can read more about the Stitching Directives in the documentation.](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/stitching/docs/approaches/stitching-directives#directives-glossary)

</Callout>

```graphql filename="subschemas/users.graphql"
directive @merge(
  keyField: String
  keyArg: String
  additionalArgs: String
  key: [String!]
  argsExpr: String
) on FIELD_DEFINITION

directive @canonical on OBJECT | INTERFACE | INPUT_OBJECT | UNION | ENUM | SCALAR | FIELD_DEFINITION | INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION

type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String!
}

type Query {
  users(ids: [ID!]!): [User]! @merge(keyField: "id") @canonical
}
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

<Callout type="info">

type Post {
  id: ID!
  message: String!
  author: User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  posts: [Post]
}

type Query {
  post(id: ID!): Post
  users(ids: [ID!]!): [User]! @merge(keyField: "id")
}
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Hive CLI Access Token

As you may have noticed, Hive has created three targets under your project: `development`,
`staging`, and `production`. This guide will use the `development` target to explore the features
Hive offers.

To begin, select the `development` target under your Hive project and then choose the **Settings**
tab. On the Settings screen, you can manage your target's settings and access tokens.

Under the **Registry Access Tokens** section, click the **Generate new token** button. Give your
access token a name and select **Schema Check & Push** from the list of token presets:

<NextImage
  alt="Create Registry Token Form"
  src={tokenImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-md rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

Click on **Generate Token** button and you should get your CLI token created, with permissions to
publish GraphQL schemas.

Make sure to copy your token and keep it safe. **You won't be able to see it again.**

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** You can create multiple tokens with different permissions for different use cases.
</Callout>

### Publish your schemas

Now that you have your access token, you can publish your schema to the registry.

We'll start with the **Users** service.

Run the following command in your terminal, to publish your `subschemas/users.graphql` to the
registry (replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with the token you have just created):

```bash
hive schema:publish \
  --registry.accessToken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE \
  --service="users" \
  --url="http://fake.com/users/graphql" \
  --author "Me" \
  --commit "First" \
  subschemas/users.graphql
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you are running under a NodeJS project, make sure to include the `npx`, `yarn` or `pnpm` prefix
  to the command.
</Callout>

If everything goes well, you should see the following output:

```bash copy=false
✔ Published initial schema.
```

If you'll get to your target's page on Hive dashboard, you should see that it was updated with the
new schema you just published 🎉

<NextImage
  alt="Stitching SDL"
  src={stitchingUserSchemaImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

<Callout type="info">
  You should also check out the **Explorer** tab: you can see the schema you just published, and
  explore the API types, fields, and arguments.
</Callout>

Now, let's publish the **Posts** service schema to Hive:

```bash
hive schema:publish \
  --registry.accessToken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE \
  --service="posts" \
  --url="http://fake.com/posts/graphql" \
  --author "Me" \
  --commit "Second" \
  subschemas/posts.graphql
```

If everything goes well, you should see the following output:

```bash copy=false
✔ Schema published
```

On your target's **Explorer** page now, you'll be able to see the schema of both services 🎉

<NextImage
  alt="Schema Explorer"
  src={stitchingExplorerImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

### Schema Checks

Hive can perform several checks on your schema before publishing it to the registry. You can use
Hive CLI to run these check and find potential breaking changes, and potential composition issues
when a Stitching project is used.

To see how schema checks works, let's make a small change to our schema. First, we'll start with a
non-breaking change - we'll add a new field to the `User` type under the **Users** service:

```graphql {15} filename="subschemas/users.graphql"
directive @merge(
  keyField: String
  keyArg: String
  additionalArgs: String
  key: [String!]
  argsExpr: String
) on FIELD_DEFINITION

directive @canonical on OBJECT | INTERFACE | INPUT_OBJECT | UNION | ENUM | SCALAR | FIELD_DEFINITION | INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION

type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String!
  age: Int
}

type Query {
  users(ids: [ID!]!): [User]! @merge(keyField: "id") @canonical
}
```

Now, run the Hive CLI with the `schema:check` command and your modified `subschemas/users.graphql`
file:

```bash
hive schema:check \
  --registry.accessToken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE \
  --service="users" \
  subschemas/users.graphql
```

You should see that Hive successfully detect the change you made, and exists with a `0` exit code,
meaning that the schema is compatible, valid and has no breaking changes:

```bash copy=false
ℹ Detected 1 change

- Field age was added to object type User
```

Now, are going to try introduce a breaking change. To do that, we'll rename an existing field in the
GraphQL schema of the **Users** service:

```graphql {14} filename="subschemas/users.graphql"
directive @merge(
  keyField: String
  keyArg: String
  additionalArgs: String
  key: [String!]
  argsExpr: String
) on FIELD_DEFINITION

directive @canonical on OBJECT | INTERFACE | INPUT_OBJECT | UNION | ENUM | SCALAR | FIELD_DEFINITION | INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION

type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  emailAddress: String! # was "email" before
}

type Query {
  users(ids: [ID!]!): [User]! @merge(keyField: "id") @canonical
}
```

Now, run the Hive CLI with the `schema:check` command again and the modified
`subschemas/users.graphql` file:

```bash
hive schema:check \
  --registry.accessToken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE \
  --service="users" \
  subschemas/users.graphql
```

In that case, you'll notice that Hive CLI exists with a `1` exit code, meaning that the schema has
breaking changes, and it's not compatible with the current schema in the registry:

```bash copy=false
✖ Detected 1 error

- Breaking Change: Field email was removed from object type User

ℹ Detected 2 changes

- Field email was removed from object type User
- Field emailAddress was added to object type User
```

In addition to detecting simple breaking changes, Hive is capable of detecting composability issues
across your services. To see how it works, let's make a small change to our schema.

We are going to add a conflict to the **Users** service. We are going to add a new field (`posts`)
to the `User` type, that conflicts with the `User` type in the **Posts** service.

```graphql {15} filename="subschemas/users.graphql"
directive @merge(
  keyField: String
  keyArg: String
  additionalArgs: String
  key: [String!]
  argsExpr: String
) on FIELD_DEFINITION

directive @canonical on OBJECT | INTERFACE | INPUT_OBJECT | UNION | ENUM | SCALAR | FIELD_DEFINITION | INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION

type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String!
  posts: Boolean # conflict with the "Posts" service
}

type Query {
  users(ids: [ID!]!): [User]! @merge(keyField: "id") @canonical
}
```

Run the Hive CLI with the `schema:check` command again and the modified `subschemas/users.graphql`
file:

```bash
hive schema:check \
  --registry.accessToken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE \
  --service="users" \
  subschemas/users.graphql
```

And now you can see that the schema check process has failed, due to conflicts and inconsistencies
between the schemas:

```bash copy=false
✖ Detected 2 errors

- Failed to compare schemas: Failed to build schema: Error: Definitions of field User.posts implement inconsistent list types across subschemas and cannot be merged.
- Definitions of field User.posts implement inconsistent list types across subschemas and cannot be merged.
```

### Evolve your schema

Now that you have your schema published, you can evolve it over time. You can add new types, fields,
and implement new capabilities for your consumers.

Let's make a valid change in our schema and push it again to the registry:

```graphql {15} filename="subschemas/users.graphql"
directive @merge(
  keyField: String
  keyArg: String
  additionalArgs: String
  key: [String!]
  argsExpr: String
) on FIELD_DEFINITION

directive @canonical on OBJECT | INTERFACE | INPUT_OBJECT | UNION | ENUM | SCALAR | FIELD_DEFINITION | INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION

type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String!
  age: Int
}

type Query {
  users(ids: [ID!]!): [User]! @merge(keyField: "id") @canonical
}
```

And publish it to Hive:

```bash
hive schema:publish \
  --registry.accessToken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE \
  --service="users" \
  --url="http://fake.com/users/graphql" \
  --author "Me" \
  --commit "Third" \
  subschemas/users.graphql
```

You should see now that Hive accepted your published schema and updated the registry:

```bash copy=false
✔ Schema published
```

It's a good timing to check the **History** tab of your Hive target. You should see that a new
schema is published now, and you can see the changes you made:

<NextImage
  alt="Schema History"
  src={stitchingHistoryImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

### Fetch your schema

Now that your GraphQL schema is stored in the Hive registry, you can access and fetch it through
Hive's CDN (Content Delivery Network).

The Hive Cloud service leverages the
[CloudFlare Global Network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) to deliver your GraphQL schema and
schema metadata. This means that your schema will be available from the nearest location to your
GraphQL gateway, with 100% uptime, regardless of Hive's status. This ensures that everything
required for your GraphQL API is always available, and reduces the risk of depending on Hive as a
single point of failure.
[You can read more about Hive's CDN here](/docs/features/high-availability-cdn).

To get started with Hive's CDN access, you'll need to create a CDN token from your target's
**Settings** page. You'll see a separate section for managing and creating CDN tokens, called **CDN
Access Token**.

Click on **Create new CDN Token** to create a new CDN token. Describe your token with an alias, and
click **Create**. Please store this access token securely. **You will not be able to see it again.**

<Callout type="info">
**Why are Registry and CDN tokens different?**

We use a separate, externally managed storage to manage CDN tokens to ensure high availability of
your schemas. This approach ensures that your GraphQL schemas are fully secured and highly
available. CDN tokens are read-only and can only fetch schemas from the CDN. They do not have
permissions to perform any other action on your Hive organization.

</Callout>

To use your access token, go to your target's page on Hive's dashboard and click on the **Connect to
CDN** button. You will see a screen with instructions on how to obtain different types of artifacts
from the CDN. For this guide, you can pick the **GraphQL SDL** artifact.

<NextImage
  alt="CDN Token Form"
  src={cdnTokenImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

Copy the URL and let's try to fetch your schema using `curl` (replace `YOUR_HIVE_CDN_TOKEN` with
your CDN token, and `CDN_ENDPOINT_HERE` with the endpoint you copied from Hive's dashboard):

```bash
curl -L -H "X-Hive-CDN-Key: YOUR_HIVE_CDN_TOKEN" CDN_ENDPOINT_HERE
```

You should see that Hive CDN returns your full GraphQL schema as an output for that command.

### A simple gateway

Now that you have your schema published, and the schema is available on Hive's CDN, you can use it
to build a simple GraphQL gateway.

In addition to the SDL endpoint exposed from Hive's CDN, you can also use the `/services` endpoint
to fetch a list of all services and their metadata (url and name).

As part of [Hive Client](/docs/api-reference/client#javascript--nodejs-client) library, we are also
exposing utilities for fetching and integrating your schema with your gateway.

Here's a short snippet of how you can fetch the services information from Hive CDN, and start a
GraphQL gateway using GraphQL-Yoga:

```ts
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { buildSchema } from 'graphql'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServicesFetcher } from '@graphql-hive/client'
import { stitchSchemas } from '@graphql-tools/stitch'
import { stitchingDirectives } from '@graphql-tools/stitching-directives'

const { stitchingDirectivesTransformer } = stitchingDirectives()

const fetchServices = createServicesFetcher({
  endpoint: process.env.HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT,
  key: process.env.HIVE_CDN_KEY
})

async function main() {
  const services = await fetchServices()
  const subschemas = services.map(service => {
    return {
      schema: buildSchema(service.sdl, { assumeValid: true, assumeValidSDL: true }),
      executor: buildHTTPExecutor({ endpoint: service.url }),
      subschemaConfigTransforms: [stitchingDirectivesTransformer]
    }
  })

  const schema = stitchSchemas({
    subschemas
  })
  const yoga = createYoga({ schema })
  const server = createServer(yoga)

  server.listen(4000, () => {
    console.info('Gateway is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
  })
}

main().catch(err => {
  console.error(err)
  process.exit(1)
})
```

<Callout type="info">

Make sure to add environment variables:

`HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT` is your Hive CDN endpoint (without the artficat type, just drop the `/sdl` or
`/services` from the URL).

`HIVE_CDN_KEY` is the Hive CDN Access Token you created earlier.

</Callout>
