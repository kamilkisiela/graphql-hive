# CDN Artifacts

By default, the self-hosted Hive instance does not come with an CDN, as this requires an external
service such as Cloudflare. However, you can enable fallback CDN route handlers that are exposed via
the `server` docker container.

<Callout>
  Please not that these route handlers are obviously not as performant and highly-available as a
  real CDN.
</Callout>

You need to set the following environment variables.

```bash filename="Environment variables for the server container"
# Enable the CDN API route handlers
CDN_API=1
# The (public) base url of the server container
CDN_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```
