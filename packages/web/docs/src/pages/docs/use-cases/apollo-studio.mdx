to GraphQL Hive, allowing developers to quickly adapt and continue their work without interruption.

**GraphQL Hive champions the open source ethos**. Entirely MIT licensed, it offers unparalleled
freedom to its users, enabling them to customize and extend the platform as needed. This commitment
to openness also helps developers avoid vendor lock-in, granting them full control over their
GraphQL infrastructure.

GraphQL Hive does not gate any features behind a paywall. Self-hosted and cloud-hosted options are
identical.
