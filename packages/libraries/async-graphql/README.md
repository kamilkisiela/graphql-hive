# Hive Client for async-graphql

---

[GraphQL Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) is a schema registry for GraphQL. With Hive you
manage and collaborate on all your GraphQL schemas and GraphQL workflows, regardless of the
underlying strategy, engine or framework youâ€™re using: this includes Schema Stitching, Apollo
Federation, or just a traditional monolith approach.

> Hive and all of its components are developed and managed as an MIT open-source project.
