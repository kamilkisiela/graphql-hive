# Hive Client for async-graphql

---

This is a client for integrating [GraphQL Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) with Rust servers using the `async-graphql` library. It allows you to report GraphQL schema changes and collect usage metrics, providing observability and performance tracking for your `async-graphql` API, without needing Apollo Router as a gateway.

> Hive is an open-source schema registry and observability tool for managing GraphQL workflows, developed under the MIT license.
